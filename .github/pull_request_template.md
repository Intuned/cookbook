# Template PR Checklist

- [ ] Template exists in both TypeScript and Python (or noted why only one language)
- [ ] Uses `@intuned/browser` (TypeScript) or `intuned_browser` (Python) helpers where applicable
- [ ] `testParameters/` directory exists for each API (and AuthSession if applicable)
- [ ] Job scripts added to `package.json`/`pyproject.toml` if template is meant to run as a job (and for AuthSession if applicable)
- [ ] README written following existing example structure (similar to `rpa-auth-example/README.md` or `quick-recipes/README.md`)
- [ ] Main README and language-specific README updated if adding/modifying examples
